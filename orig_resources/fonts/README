vSHandprinted font downloaded from http://openfontlibrary.org/en/font/vshandprinted

Use hiero to create two versions for in game usage:

1: size 16 for UI skin
2: size 32 for distance field version that can scale nicely.

Place version 1 in my-gdx-game-android/assets/skin and version 2 in
my-gdx-game-android/assets/fonts

You can start hiero from libgdx (only nightly build version works):

java -cp gdx.jar;gdx-natives.jar;gdx-backend-lwjgl.jar;gdx-backend-lwjgl-natives.jar;extensions\gdx-tools\gdx-tools.jar com.badlogic.gdx.tools.hiero.Hiero
