Level files are json files that hold are required level data.

More or less it should contain the following:

	gameObjects:	a list of gameobjects
	doors:		a list of exits to next levels
	viewSize:	the level view size. This may differ from the actual 
			level world size to allow levels to be larger then
			the screen
	worldSize:	the level world size. This is the actual size of the 
			level. Note that you can use viewSize to determine how
			much of the world the user sees on screen without 
			needing to scroll.
	reachable:	used to mark the level as reachable or not in the level
			editor.
	position:	the level's position in the game
	entryLevels:	level positions that allow access to this level.

The entryLevels attribute is needed to be able to generate a list of paths leading
to the current level. This is required to determine if level is reachable and to 
determine if the level will contain enough balloons of the right colour to be playable.
