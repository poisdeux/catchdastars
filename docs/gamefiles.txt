games/
   in_progress/
       <GAME_UUID>-<NUMBER>/
         levels_completed/
             <POSITION>
             ...

         levels/
             <POSITION>
             ...
         meta
       ...


in_progress/
------------

Holds game progression. As there can be multiple saved game states of the same 
original game, we add a number to the game directory <GAME_UUID>-<NUMBER>/

  <GAME_UUID>-<NUMBER>/levels_completed/	Contains the levels that have 
						been completed. These level 
						files typically contain the 
						state of the level at the moment
						the level was completed. 

  <GAME_UUID>-<NUMBER>/meta			Contains the current meta data 
						of the saved game. Typically 
						the only difference with the 
						original file will be the 
						current total score.


originals
---------

Holds the original game files as created by the designer of the game. These should only
be modified by the game editor. 

  <GAME_UUID>/levels/	The level files are named after their position in the game.

  <GAME_UUID>/meta	Contains generic meta-data about the game.
