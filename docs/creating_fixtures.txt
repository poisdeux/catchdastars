1. Start physics-body-editor
  
  java -jar tools/physics-body-editor/physics-body-editor.jar

2. Create a new project or load an existing project in assets/fixtures/

3. Add new bodies using "+ new" and select "create body from image" 
   or "create bodies from images" if you are creating a breakable object

4. For each body draw its edges. Remember the less points the edge contains
   the less resources it needs to calculate a collision during the game

5. If you are creating a breakable object consisting of multiple bodies make
   sure the origin is set (kept) to 0,0 for all bodies.
